# RenegadeGBA V0.1.1

This is a Renegade & Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun - Arcade emulator for the GBA.
It has no sound support.
You should still be able to enjoy the game though. =)

## How to use

Now put renegade.zip, kuniokun.zip into a folder where you have arcade roms.

When the emulator starts, you press L+R to open up the menu (the emulator tries
to load Renegade automagically on startup). Now you can use the cross to
navigate the menus, A to select an option, B to go back a step.

## Menu

* Load Game: Select a game to load.
* Load State: Load a previously saved state for the currently running game.

### Controller

* Controller: 2P start a 2 player game.
* Swap A/B: Swap which GBA button is mapped to which arcade button.
